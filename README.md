CS429 is the first course in the systems core sequence required of all UT CS majors. It describes how computers operate at a fairly low level of abstraction. For example, we'll consider:
What are the components of a computer and how do they fit together?
How do computers do arithmetic?
How does the code you write actually execute?
How does a program in a high level language like C get translated into a form the machine can execute?
How is information stored and accessed?
How can you write code likely to execute efficiently?
Understanding these fundamentals thoroughly is absolutely essential to your future success in computer science. The material of this course is quite detailed and requires careful and diligent study. If you are not willing to put in the time and effort required to master this material, you probably should reconsider your decision to major in Computer Science.
The UT College of Natural Sciences recently published Vision and Recommendations for 21st Century Undergraduate Education (June, 2016). It contains these words:

"Research on learning shows that transformative education requires teaching methods that engage students in productive intellectual struggles. Students must personally grapple with scientific and mathematical concepts to develop a deep understanding of core principles. They must be given opportunities to overcome obstacles and failure to develop an acceptance of ambiguity and a willingness to persevere."
In this class, you won't succeed unless you do some struggling, grappling and persevering, and accept ambiguity! Not everything will be spelled out for you and there are a number of skills you'll have to acquire on your own. You will be asked to complete some very challenging assignments. In some cases you will be expected to use tools and techniques that are not discussed in class. That is not to say that help is not available; just that we expect you to be proactive about learning. This is a skill you must acquire now, because you'll need it for your entire academic and professional career. Toto, I don't think we're in high school anymore!
